# Movie Test



## Install
As simple as this:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Start the project

```bash
$ npm run start-dev
```
or

```bash
$ npm run start-pro
```
In a browser go to:

```
localhost:8080
```

## Test


```bash
$ npm run test-dev
```
or
```bash
$ npm run test-chrome
```
or
```bash
$ npm run start-pro
```
I recommend to use `npm run test-chrome`.

You can see the test coverage inside the folder "test-coverage".


## Build
This script will create a 'dist' folder with the scripts ready to serve in production

```bash
$ npm run build-pro
```
